Code to replicate some of the experiments given in my lecture
[High-Dimensional Statistics and Sparsity](
http://jmota.eps.hw.ac.uk/documents/Mota21-HighDimensionalStatsAndSparsity-UDRC.pdf)
at [UDRC-EURASIP Summer School](
https://udrc.eng.ed.ac.uk/udrc-eurasip-summer-school-2021 ).  

All code is in MATLAB. The slides can be found
[here](http://jmota.eps.hw.ac.uk/documents/Mota21-HighDimensionalStatsAndSparsity-UDRC.pdf).

# Structure

* crime   (requires [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/))
* glasso  (requires [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/))
* image-recon  (requires
  [sparco](https://github.com/MPF-Optimization-Laboratory/Sparco) and [spgl1](https://friedlander.io/spgl1/) toolboxes)
* lda
* nuc_norm  (**warning:** execution time is long, so it contains .mat file with saved results)
